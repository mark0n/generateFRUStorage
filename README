  This program generates the binary content of the IPMI FRU storage area
  according to
    - IPMI Platform Management FRU Information Storage Definition v1.0 [1]
    - PICMG AMC.0 R2.0. Advanced Mezzanine Card Base Specification
    - PICMG MicroTCA.4 R1.0 MicroTCA Enhancements for Rear I/O and Precision
      Timing

  Note: Only a subset of the above specifications is supported. Sending patches
  is greatly appreciated.

  generateFRUStorage is a pure command-line tool which means it can be used as
  part of some automatic build/deployment process.

Software requirements:
  - CMake
  - C++ compiler (e.g. g++ or clang++)
    Note: generateFRUStorage makes use of C++11 features. Make sure you are
    using a recent compiler (e.g. clang >= 3.0).
  - gcov (optional, only needed to extract code covarage information)
  - lcov (optional, generates nice code coverage reports)

Installation:
  Run the following commands to compile and install the software:

  > mkdir build
  > cd build
  > cmake ..
  > make
  > sudo make install

Using the tool:
  The program is automatically executed after the build is finished. This
  generates the binary FRU data file. Of course you can run it manually as
  well:

  > generateFRUStorage -i FRU_data_FGPDB.json -o FRU_data_FGPDB.bin

  In some cases the resulting file can not be flashed into the EEPROM directly.
  E.g. with my Atmel JTAGICE3 programmer I have to convert it into a hex file
  first using SRecord [2]:

  > srec_cat fru_data.bin -binary -output fru_data.hex -intel

Unit tests:
  All relevant parts of the tool are covered by unit tests which can be run by

  > make test

  To run a subset of tests that match "varLengthLangCodeFieldTests" issue

  > ctest -R varLengthLangCodeFieldTests

Code coverage:
  To extract useful code coverage information the tool needs to be build
  without optimization:

  > mkdir build
  > cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
  > make testGenerateFRUStorage_coverage

  Coverage data can be found in build/coverage/index.html
