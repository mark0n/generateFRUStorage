The Debian Package generate-fru-storage
----------------------------

This program generates the binary content of the IPMI FRU storage area
according to
  - IPMI Platform Management FRU Information Storage Definition v1.0 [1]
  - PICMG AMC.0 R2.0. Advanced Mezzanine Card Base Specification
  - PICMG MicroTCA.4 R1.0 MicroTCA Enhancements for Rear I/O and Precision
    Timing

Note: Only a subset of the above specifications is supported. Sending patches
is greatly appreciated.

generateFRUStorage is a pure command-line tool which means it can be used as
part of some automatic build/deployment process.
